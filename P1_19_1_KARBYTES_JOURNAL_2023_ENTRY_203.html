<p>Today I bought a purple elastic chord for ~$10 from REI to use to secure my backpack&#8217;s top opening (because the original straps already broke and I lost some articles of clothing because they fell out of the top of the backpack because, before I added the purple elastic chord, the backpack did not stay securely shut). I also bought an &#8220;Afro&#8221; large men&#8217;s fleece jacket for approximately ~$90 to use as the outer shell to what I normally wear: a yellow hoodie jacket, several compression undergarments designed to retain body heat, and a quick dry shirt as the base layer touching my skin which absorbs sweat and prevents my skin from getting sticky and wet).</p>
<p>As an &#8220;advanced amateur&#8221; urban camper and outdoor enthusiast (who spends most of its time outside of buildings and outside of closed vehicles), <span style="background:#ffff00">I seemingly cannot overstate the importance of investing in warm, windproof, and waterproof clothing as quickly as possible and to buy such clothing from sports and outdoor specialty stores (or online (and local Amazon lockers are available at places like grocery stores which may be useful to people who lack personal mailing addresses))</span> rather than to attempt to find cheaper alternatives at cheap general stores like Walmart and Target. (I have purchased a new pair of dark blue-gray straight loose-fitting jeans from Target for ~$30 and quick-dry shirts (each ~$10) and thick silky black and gray basketball shorts which have pockets and which extend slightly past the knee (each $20) from Walmart recently. I generally wear those shorts underneath my jeans when temperatures are cold or when I am in a professional or industrious mode. During the summer months I might just travel to the beach wearing only swim clothes on (while leaving my entire backpack and and electronics in a motel room which only I am renting (and perhaps leave my wallet behind and only take out a pre-loaded BART clipper card and motel room key (and thankfully the hotel staff can make new keys if the original gets lost or is broken))) so that I can quickly dry off and not get hypothermia from dunking myself in the cold Pacific ocean water at Thornton Beach (which is about a mile&#8217;s walk away from the Daly City BART train station). I might do that as part of some weird personal spiritual rituals to refresh and inspire my soul as a modern sage, survivalist, environmental activist, and digital content creator).</p>
<p>Anyway, I could go on and on extolling the benefits of having proper clothes (which actually make it possible for me to feel COMFORTABLE (and not just for a few minutes at a time, but rather, consistently from one minute to the next without frequent and prolonged disrupts in such &#8220;home-ness&#8221;)). I am trying to &#8220;sell&#8221; the &#8220;lifestyle&#8221; of portable, versatile, and athletic/intellectual/spiritual fitness. It involves the minimization of hoarding (both digitally and physically). I want my body to feel like a cozy, mobile, and reliable mobile home and vehicle which takes me everywhere I want to go (excluding the experiences I seek to have which hypothetically involve &#8220;astral projection&#8221; and &#8220;time travel&#8221; and &#8220;teleportation&#8221; such that I may have to go through an &#8220;out of body experience&#8221; in order to attain esoteric wisdom and special first-hand experience).</p>

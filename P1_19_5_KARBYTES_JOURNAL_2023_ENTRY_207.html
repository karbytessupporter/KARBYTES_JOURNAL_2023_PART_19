<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Today I played with the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a> playground web application (which is a free (to start) cloud-based artificial intelligence service yet requires that each user create an OpenAI account) by entering text into a text field and clicking a submit button after typing in plain-text input. AI-generated plain text output is generated within seconds of me pressing the submit button. What follows is a transcript of my second “conversation” with OpenAI. </span></p>

<p>What is your favorite algorithm?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">My favorite algorithm is Quicksort. It is an efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach, which means it divides a large array into two smaller sub-arrays and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays. It is often considered the most efficient sorting algorithm with an average time complexity of O(n log n).</span></p>
<p>What is your favorite color?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">My favorite color is blue.</span></p>
<p>Why is your favorite color blue and not some other color?</p>
<p><span style="background:#00ff00">I like blue because it&#8217;s calming and peaceful, and it&#8217;s a color that has many different shades and hues that can be easily mixed and matched to create beautiful visual effects. Blue also has a strong connection to the sky and ocean, which can be very calming.</span></p>

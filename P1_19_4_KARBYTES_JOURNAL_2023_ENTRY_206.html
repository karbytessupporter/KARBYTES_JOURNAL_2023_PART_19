<p><span style="background:#ffff00">Today I played with the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenAI</a> playground web application (which is a free cloud-based artificial intelligence service yet requires that each user create an OpenAI account) by entering text into a text field and clicking a submit button after typing in plain-text input. AI-generated plain text output is generated within seconds of me pressing the submit button. What follows is a transcript of my first &#8220;conversation&#8221; with OpenAI. (Warning: do not submit content which contains vulgar or potentially criminalizing information like I did. I got &#8220;flagged&#8221; for typing the word &#8220;cock&#8221; apparently).</span></p>
